Namaste Amazing people,

Thank you for showing interest in reading about me and blogs. Let me Introduce myself to you. 

My name is Pankaj Borade, and I am a final-year student at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SV-NIT Surat), pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. I’m currently a part of the Google Summer of Code 2024 under JdeRobot. I will be mentored by Dr. José María Cañas and Toshan Luktuke from JdeRobot. 

I have a strong interest in developing skills in software development and robotics. I am passionate about technology and have gained experience working on various development projects using technologies such as React, Node.js, Docker, MongoDB, ROS2, Unity3D, C#, AWS, JavaScript, GitHub Actions, Python, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I possess excellent problem-solving skills and a sound understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

### Programming Background and Projects
Through my academic journey, I have completed several projects and internships.

**My internships include:**

1. **Full Stack Developer (Human-Robot Interface) Intern - ARTPARK, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore (Jan 2024 - April 2024)**:
   - Development of the ReactJS-based user interface and dockerized the middleware
   - Deployment of UI and middleware on AWS
   - Integrated the stack with the robot and enhanced the middleware

2. **Software Developer (Embedded) Intern - Anantkaal, Surat (May 2023 - June 2023)**:
   - Worked on the implementation of RS485, MODBUS, and external flash memory with the STM32 microcontroller

**My projects include:**

1. **Shiva 3.4 Humanoid Robot (Nov 2015-Present)**:
   - Started building this robot in 8th grade
   - Capable of tasks like talking, listening, walking, and dancing
   - Communicates via Bluetooth through the Shiva 3.4 app
   - Ongoing efforts to refine custom commands, improve balance, and implement feedback systems

2. **Robocon (Aug 2021-June 2023)**:
   - Represented SVNIT in the prestigious Robocon India competition
   - Successfully implemented PID-controlled three and four-wheel omni drive systems using an inverse kinematics algorithm
   - Interfaced various components such as stepper motors, servo motors, drives, and pneumatics with a PS4 controller, enabling intuitive control
   - Integrated encoder and IMU sensors into the system

3. **Four-legged Robot (July 2023-Dec 2023)**:
   - This project was my final year BTech project
   - The robot utilizes the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) ESP32 for executing tasks such as walking, crawling, and making turns
   - Simulated transmitter and receiver circuits using Multisim and designed the PCB on EasyEDA

4. **StudentConnect Hub (July 2023-Aug 2023)**:
   - Developed a website where students can easily report problems and track their progress
   - Implemented verification-based registration through ID card PDF submission with hierarchical complaint forwarding to ensure timely solutions
   - Technologies utilized include HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Node.js, JavaScript and MongoDB

   ### Google Summer of Code
   Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that brings student developers into open source software development. It offers students stipends to work on a three-month programming project under the guidance of expert mentors from participating open-source organizations. GSoC has been instrumental in introducing students to the vast world of open-source software, fostering innovative thinking, and facilitating the creation of various essential software tools.

   ### JdeRobot
   JdeRobot is an open-source toolkit that simplifies the complex task of building robotics applications. It promotes the integration of existing nodes or libraries, and provides various tools, libraries, and reusable nodes for robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. It is fully compatible with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and supports multiple languages, including C++, Python, and JavaScript. JdeRobot is particularly renowned for its contributions to robotics education and game development, machine learning in robotics, and reconfigurable computing in robotics.

   ### VisualCircuit
   VisualCircuit is a platform developed by JdeRobot that allows users to program robotic intelligence using a visual language consisting of blocks and wires, similar to electronic circuits. This solution by JdeRobot simplifies the process for those who want to create code for robotics applications such as Deep Learning, ROS, etc.
