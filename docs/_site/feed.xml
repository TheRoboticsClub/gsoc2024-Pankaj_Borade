This was my first time having my work released and published on JdeRobot’s social media platforms [2] [3]. I observed an issue where the value remained the same in the internal constant of identical blocks. This issue occurred when I used multiple laser blocks in the project for the Autoparking exercise. Toshan verified this issue during a meeting on his system.</p>

<p>Dr. JoseMaria explained the internal workings of RADI and the Robotics Application Manager. He assigned me the task of researching and understanding RAM. Additionally, he suggested running the VisualCircuit robotics application directly from a zip file inside RADI, which will automatically unzip and run the main.py of VisualCircuit. Previously, I was copying the unzipped files to the Docker image, but with this new method, the directly built version will be used in the Docker image.</p>

<h2 id="work-done">Work Done</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Created an issue for the value remaining the same in the internal constant of identical blocks.</li>
  <li>Researched the architecture and functioning of the Robotics Application Manager.</li>
  <li>Ran the VisualCircuit robotics application by unzipping it inside the RA Docker image.</li>

<p>As you landed on my first week of community bonding period progress so you will have some idea about myself. If not then My name is Pankaj Borade, and I am a final-year student at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT Surat), pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>

<p>First of all, it was my dream from my first year to work in GSoC with a mixed robotics and software tech stack, and that dream came true on 1st May 2024. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the entire JdeRobot community, especially Dr. JoseMaria and Toshan, and the other incredible open-source developers, for providing me with this opportunity.</p>

<p>Now let’s together start the GSoC 2024 blog. I will be working on VisualCircuit Block library project. Basically it includes automated testing with GitHub Actions, refining block composition, and much more in VisualCircuit.Additionally, there was the first GSoC meeting with mentors Dr. JoseMaria and Toshan on May 6th. I also joined the community group on Slack.</p>

<h2 id="work-done">Work Done</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Completed setup of RoboticsAcademy for ROS2 Humble</li>
  <li>Created Blog website</li>
  <li>Created video and completed Autoparking of RA through VisualCircuit using ROS2 blocks.</li>
</ol>
