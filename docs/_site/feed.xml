  <li>
    <h4 id="first-yaml-file-for-github-actions">First yaml file for Github Actions</h4>
    <p>First of all, it was my first time writing a YAML file for GitHub Actions. I used resources such as YouTube videos [1] and GitHub Actions documentation [2]  to help me write the initial script. From the discussions, it was clear that testing should trigger when there is a pull request to the master branch, so I started with that and followed the VisualCircuit documentation for the frontend installation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>First failure of coding period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="creating-workflow-for-installation-process">Creating workflow for installation process</h4>
    <p>The initial idea was to create a separate workflow for the installation process. This installation workflow would be reused for every test and other workflows. I worked on this and resolved the above issue by including ‘–legacy-peer-deps’ at the end of the ‘npm install’ command.</p>

    <h4 id="research-and-modifying-the-workflow">Research and modifying the workflow</h4>
    <p>I reviewed some open source projects such as RocketChat and Volto by the Plone Foundation to understand the CI pipeline workflow. I realized that creating a separate workflow for installation is uncommon and not a best practice. Instead, I created a setup job and stored the results in artifacts for use in different tests (jobs).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I encountered a “MODULE NOT FOUND” frontend error because I stored node modules in artifacts. Storing node modules in artifacts is not ideal since artifacts are typically used for build files. Stack Overflow and GitHub Actions documentation [3] suggested using Action Cache instead. After switching to Action Cache, the issue was resolved, and I proceeded to the next step of basic frontend testing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="ci-workflow-with-basic-frontend-test">CI Workflow with basic frontend test</h4>
    <p>For basic frontend testing, I researched Jest and React testing frameworks commonly used for unit tests on the React side. I used prebuilt React tests and initially printed the rendered HTML in the terminal. Based on this, I identified the menubar elements and added a basic test to find and verify that the “File” text is present in the rendered App.</p>

This was my first time having my work released and published on JdeRobot’s social media platforms [2] [3]. I observed an issue where the value remained the same in the internal constant of identical blocks. This issue occurred when I used multiple laser blocks in the project for the Autoparking exercise. Toshan verified this issue during a meeting on his system.</p>

<p>Dr. JoseMaria explained the internal workings of RADI and the Robotics Application Manager. He assigned me the task of researching and understanding RAM. Additionally, he suggested running the VisualCircuit robotics application directly from a zip file inside RADI, which will automatically unzip and run the main.py of VisualCircuit. Previously, I was copying the unzipped files to the Docker image, but with this new method, the directly built version will be used in the Docker image.</p>

<p>As you landed on my first week of community bonding period progress so you will have some idea about myself. If not then My name is Pankaj Borade, and I am a final-year student at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT Surat), pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>

<p>First of all, it was my dream from my first year to work in GSoC with a mixed robotics and software tech stack, and that dream came true on 1st May 2024. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the entire JdeRobot community, especially Dr. JoseMaria and Toshan, and the other incredible open-source developers, for providing me with this opportunity.</p>

<p>Now let’s together start the GSoC 2024 blog. I will be working on VisualCircuit Block library project. Basically it includes automated testing with GitHub Actions, refining block composition, and much more in VisualCircuit.Additionally, there was the first GSoC meeting with mentors Dr. JoseMaria and Toshan on May 6th. I also joined the community group on Slack.</p>

<h2 id="work-done">Work Done</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Completed setup of RoboticsAcademy for ROS2 Humble</li>
  <li>Created Blog website</li>
  <li>Created video and completed Autoparking of RA through VisualCircuit using ROS2 blocks.</li>
</ol>
