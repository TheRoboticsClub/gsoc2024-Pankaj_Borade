Hello everyone,

As you landed on my first week of community bonding period progress so you will have some idea about myself. If not then My name is Pankaj Borade, and I am a final-year student at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT Surat), pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. 

First of all, it was my dream from my first year to work in GSoC with a mixed robotics and software tech stack, and that dream came true on 1st May 2024. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the entire JdeRobot community, especially Dr. JoseMaria and Toshan, and the other incredible open-source developers, for providing me with this opportunity. 

Now let's together start the GSoC 2024 blog. I will be working on VisualCircuit Block library project. Basically it includes automated testing with GitHub Actions, refining block composition, and much more in VisualCircuit.Additionally, there was the first GSoC meeting with mentors Dr. JoseMaria and Toshan on May 6th. I also joined the community group on Slack.


## Work Done
1. Completed setup of RoboticsAcademy for ROS2 Humble
2. Created Blog website
3. Created video and completed Autoparking of RA through VisualCircuit using ROS2 blocks.
