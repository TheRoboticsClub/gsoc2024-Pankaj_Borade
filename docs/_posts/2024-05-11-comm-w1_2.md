Hello everyone, I am excited to work on this project with JdeRobot Community. I have been contributing to refining block composition, implementing two or more demo robotics applications, expanding the block library, automating the testing of Visual Circuit and its documentation using GitHub Actions.

## Work Done
1. Completed setup of RoboticsAcademy for ROS2 Humble
2. Created Blog website
3. Created video and completed Autoparking of RA through VisualCircuit using ROS2 blocks.
