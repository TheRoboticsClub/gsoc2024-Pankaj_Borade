In the second week of the community bonding period, there was an introductory meeting with the entire JdeRobot community. In the meeting, Pedro and Dr. JoseMaria introduced the workflow and team, and every GSoC 2024 student introduced themselves. Apart from this meeting, there was a meeting scheduled for May 13th, but due to rainy weather in the western part of India, there was no proper connectivity, so that meeting concluded through text on Slack. After two days, Toshan rescheduled the meeting, and the following tasks were assigned and completed.

## Work Done
1. Made changes to the video, including adding subtitles and adjusting the speed of clips, as per the mentors' suggestions.
2. Learned about Releases in GitHub.
3. Generated the JSON file for the Laser ROS1 Noetic block and created a PR accordingly.
