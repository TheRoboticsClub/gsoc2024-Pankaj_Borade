In the last week of the community bonding period, a video showcasing the Autoparking exercise of RoboticsAcademy with VisualCircuit (ROS2 Humble) was released on the JdeRobot YouTube channel [1]. This was my first time having my work released and published on JdeRobot's social media platforms [2] [3]. I observed an issue where the value remained the same in the internal constant of identical blocks. This issue occurred when I used multiple laser blocks in the project for the Autoparking exercise. Toshan verified this issue during a meeting on his system.

Dr. JoseMaria explained the internal workings of RADI and the Robotics Application Manager. He assigned me the task of researching and understanding RAM. Additionally, he suggested running the VisualCircuit robotics application directly from a zip file inside RADI, which will automatically unzip and run the main.py of VisualCircuit. Previously, I was copying the unzipped files to the Docker image, but with this new method, the directly built version will be used in the Docker image.

## Work Done
1. Created an issue for the value remaining the same in the internal constant of identical blocks.
2. Researched the architecture and functioning of the Robotics Application Manager.
3. Ran the VisualCircuit robotics application by unzipping it inside the RA Docker image.
